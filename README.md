## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
CUDA (optional)
cuDNN (optional)
Python
Python packages
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone source code
```

```
CUDA (optional)
```

```
cuDNN (optional)
```

```
Python
```

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu and more
This can be done automatically by a script file
```

```
install Android Studio
```

```
until finished
```

If possibile, end with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Training
